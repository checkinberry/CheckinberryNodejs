# CheckInBerry - NodeJS

Work in progress :D

## Getting Started

This will be the backend used to consume the API of our application.

### Prerequisites

To test this code you should do the following:

### Install node.js

First of all you would have to install node.js. The following link will take you to a page to download and install it:

	[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime built
	
### Clone repository
	
We will download this project from the repository.

### Move to folder

Now we will open the terminal and you will be placed in the folder of the project that you just downloaded.
	```
	cd [folder path]
	```
### install node modules

Once positioned in the folder of our project we will execute the following command:

	
	npm install
	
	
To download the modules used by this project.
   
### run server
   
We will have created a folder called node-modules. Then in the terminal, on the project folder we will execute the following command:

	
	npm run dev
	
	
This will launch the express server.
   
With these five serious steps you can test this code.
